# Predicting_Olympic_Medal_Counts_ML_DL_Intern_Project
In this project have been explored basic machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict the number of Olympic medals a country will win. The goal of the project was to build and evaluate different models to understand which factors are most influential in predicting Olympic success.
